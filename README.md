- Step 2 : Create ADF(Azure data fabric) in Azur cloud and collect data from on-prem and othr azure storage through creating two link services.
          
      In on-prem there is no storage need to create as data is directly coming from external resource (commonly SQL server /mySQL).In that cases we direct create link service from on-prem to ADF.


- Step 3 : Create datasets and do data transmission through ADF data flow as per requirment and the will create pipeline for each data-flow.After creating pipelines we need to join each pipelines and then run the pipelines.

- Step 4 : Create one more account i.e. Azure SQL database in which final data will store after data transmission once pipeline will trigger.We need to create one more link service from ADF to Azure SQL dartabase to transfer the data.
